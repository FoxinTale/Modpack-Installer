     * The sysctl() function retrieves system information and allows processes
     * with appropriate privileges to set system information. The information
     * available from sysctl() consists of integers, strings, and tables.
     *
     * The state is described using a "Management Information Base" (MIB) style
     * name, listed in name, which is a namelen length array of integers.
     *
     * The information is copied into the buffer specified by oldp. The size of
     * the buffer is given by the location specified by oldlenp before the call,
     * and that location gives the amount of data copied after a successful call
     * and after a call that returns with the error code ENOMEM. If the amount
     * of data available is greater than the size of the buffer supplied, the
     * call supplies as much data as fits in the buffer provided and returns
     * with the error code ENOMEM. If the old value is not desired, oldp and
     * oldlenp should be set to NULL.
     *
     * The size of the available data can be determined by calling sysctl() with
     * the NULL argument for oldp. The size of the available data will be
     * returned in the location pointed to by oldlenp. For some operations, the
     * amount of space may change often. For these operations, the system
     * attempts to round up so that the returned size is large enough for a call
     * to return the data shortly thereafter.
     *
     * To set a new value, newp is set to point to a buffer of length newlen
     * from which the requested value is to be taken. If a new value is not to
     * be set, newp should be set to NULL and newlen set to 0.
